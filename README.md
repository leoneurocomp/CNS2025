# ThaCo
Thalamo-cortical spiking model with learning and sleep cycles.

# Brief history
This is the third release of a project that went along the following path.

- *ThaCo1* [2017-2019]
  - *Journal Paper*: Cristiano Capone, Elena Pastorelli, Bruno Golosio, Pier Stanislao Paolucci. Sleep-like slow oscillations improve visual classification through synaptic homeostasis and memory association in a thalamo-cortical model. Sci Rep 9, 8990 (2019). [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45525-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45525-0).
  - *Code development*: The initial version of the ThaCo1 code, limited to the learning phase was provided by Bruno Golosio and adapted to the study by Elena Pastorelli. Cristiano Capone induced in the network the capability of sleeping and created the version of the code corresponding to the Sci. Rep. Paper.
